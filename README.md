## Example Portfolios Over Time

You can use the `plot_portfolios_over_time` function to compare the performance of your portfolios over different timeframes. Below is an example of how to use it with the `example_portfolios`:

```python
plot_portfolios_over_time(example_portfolios, [8, 10, 12], use_default_size=True)
````

The above code will generate a plot that compares the portfolios' performance over 8, 10, and 12 years. You can customize the timeframes to suit your analysis.
