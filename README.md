# FinancialPortfolio Class

The FinancialPortfolio class is a Python class designed to help you simulate and analyze different financial investment strategies over time. This class allows you to create and manage portfolios consisting of multiple investment strategies. You can calculate the future values, net profits, and taxes paid for these strategies, and even compare different portfolios.

## Installation

To use the FinancialPortfolio class, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
````

## Usage

To use the FinancialPortfolio class in your Python project, you can simply import it as follows:

```python
from financial_portfolio import FinancialPortfolio, plot_portfolios, display_initial_funds_and_contributions_table
```

Once imported, you can create instances of the `FinancialPortfolio` class and use its functions to analyze and visualize your investment strategies.

## Example Portfolios

In the provided code example, we have an example portfolio named "Portfolio 1 House" with two investment strategies: "Strategy A" and "Strategy B." You can modify and expand these example portfolios to match your specific financial scenarios.

```python
example_portfolios = [
    {
        "name": "Portfolio 1 House",
        "strategies": [
            {"name": "Strategy A", "initial_funds": 0, "monthly_contribution": 800, "annual_rate": 6, "variance": 1, "is_taxable": True, "tax_rate": 10, "compounding_frequency": 6},
            {"name": "Strategy B", "initial_funds": 0, "monthly_contribution": 200, "annual_rate": 8, "variance": 1.5, "is_taxable": True, "tax_rate": 10, "compounding_frequency": 6}
        ]
    }
    # Additional portfolios can be added here
]
```

## Functions

The `FinancialPortfolio` class provides several functions for simulating and visualizing investment strategies and portfolios. These functions include:

- `calculate_aggregated_future_value(years)`: Calculate the aggregated future value of all strategies in the portfolio over a specified number of years.
- `calculate_future_value(strategy, years)`: Calculate the future value of an individual investment strategy over a specified number of years.
- `plot_strategy(strategy, years, ax)`: Plot an individual investment strategy, showing its growth, net profit, and taxes paid over time.
- `plot_combined_portfolio(years, ax)`: Plot the combined value of all strategies in the portfolio, showing the overall portfolio growth, net profit, and total taxes paid.

You can use these functions to analyze and visualize your financial portfolios.
